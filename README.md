## ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are canceled and those that are not.It is obvious that their are still a significant number of reservations that have been canceled.Their are still 37% of clients who canceled their reservations, which has a significant impact on the hotels' earnings.

In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings.It's possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.

The line graph above shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than of a resort hotel, on other days, it is even less.It goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

![Reservation_Status_Per_Month](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dcfbfc3-aa1c-4a3c-9e33-f8625bdccaec)

We have developed a grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status.As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations are largest in the month of August, whereas January is the month with the most canceled reservations.

This bar graph demonstrates that cancelations are most common when prices are greatest and are least common when they are lowest.Therefore, the cost of the accomadation is solely responsible for the cancelations.

The above chart shows which country has the highest reservations canceled.The top country is Portugal with the highest number of cancelations.

![Average_Daily_Rate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a3b48b4-f766-4063-ba82-5bbbfa37de6a)

As seen in the graph, reservations are canceled when the average daily rate are higher than when it is not canceled.It clearly proves all the above analysis, that the higher prices leads to higher cancelations.

## SUGGESTIONS -

1. Cancelation rates rise as the price does.In order to prevent cancelations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations.They can also provide some discounts to the customers.

2. As the ratio of cancelation and not cancelation of the resort hotels is higher than the city hotels.So the resort hotels should provide the reasonable discounts on the room prices on weekends or the holidays.

3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancelation is the highest in this month.

4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce cancelation rates.
